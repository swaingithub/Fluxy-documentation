# 🏁 Professional Workflow

**Build Production UI in Record Time.**

Following a standardized order of operations ensures your Fluxy app remains maintainable, performant, and premium.

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Define Reactive State (Logic First)
Start by defining your `Signals`. This decouples your business logic from the UI.

```dart
final count = flux(0);
final isLoading = flux(false);
```

## 🏗️ Step 2: Establish the Structural Shell
Use `Fx.page` or `Fx.dashboard` to define the high-level layout of your screen.

```dart
Fx.dashboard(
  sidebar: MySidebar(),
  body: MainContent(),
)
```

## 🎨 Step 3: Atomic Component Assembly
Build your UI using the Fluxy DSL. Focus on **Atomic Styling** rather than nesting.

```dart
Fx.col().children([
  Fx.text("Profile").font.xl().bold(),
  "Edit".primaryBtn(onTap: () => edit()),
])
```

## 📱 Step 4: Responsive Hardening
Apply responsive modifiers where the layout needs to adapt to larger screens.

```dart
Fx.box()
  .wFull() // Mobile Default
  .width(md: 400, lg: 600) // Tablet & Desktop adaptations
```

## ⚡ Comparison of Final UI Implementation

| Feature | Standard Flutter Workflow | Fluxy Professional Workflow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **State Sync** | `setState`, `Provider`, or `Bloc` boilerplate. | `Signal`-based atomic reactivity. |
| **UI Updates** | Rebuilding entire trees. | Fine-grained `Fx(() => widget)` updates. |
| **Styling** | Thousands of lines in a `ThemeData`. | Localized, chainable Atomic tokens. |
| **Refactoring** | Painful widget wrapping/unwrapping. | Moving modifiers up or down the chain. |

## 💎 The Fluxy Commitment
By following this order, you ensure that every screen is:
1.  **Reactive by design.**
2.  **Responsive by default.**
3.  **Performant by architecture.**
