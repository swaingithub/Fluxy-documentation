# Fluxy CLI

The Fluxy CLI facilitates project scaffolding, accelerated development, and cloud integration. It is designed to automate the heavy lifting of project management and DevOps.

## Installation

Install the Fluxy CLI globally via Dart:

```bash
dart pub global activate fluxy
```

## Core Commands

### `fluxy init <app_name>`

Scaffolds a new Fluxy project with the official architecture, boilerplate, and pre-configured state management.

```bash
fluxy init my_awesome_app
```

### `fluxy run`

The optimized development runner for Fluxy projects. It provides faster hot-reloads and environment-specific optimizations compared to standard runners.

```bash
fluxy run
```

### `fluxy doctor`

Checks your environment for Flutter and Fluxy compatibility and reports potential issues.

```bash
fluxy doctor
```

## Cloud Integration

Fluxy CLI provides built-in tools for CI/CD and cloud-based build systems.

### `fluxy cloud build <android|ios>`

Automatically configures GitHub Actions and cloud build environments for automated builds. It handles signing configurations and dependency management.

```bash
fluxy cloud build android
```

### `fluxy cloud deploy`

Sets up and executes automated deployment pipelines to TestFlight (iOS) and Google Play (Android). It automates the submission process and metadata management.

```bash
fluxy cloud deploy
```

## Generators

Generate components and boilerplate quickly to maintain project consistency.

### `fluxy gen:page <Name>`

Generates a new View, Controller, and Route entry.

```bash
fluxy gen:page Home
```

### `fluxy gen:controller <Name>`

Generates a standalone reactive controller for global or modular state.

```bash
fluxy gen:controller Auth
```
