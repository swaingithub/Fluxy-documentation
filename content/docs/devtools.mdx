# DevTools & Debugging

Inspect state and performance in real-time with Fluxy DevTools.

## Enable DevTools

Wrap your root application with `Fluxy.debug` to enable the development tools:

```dart
runApp(Fluxy.debug(child: MyApp()));
```

## Signal Graph

The **Signal Graph** visualizes your application's reactive state. It shows all active signals, their current values, and the number of active subscribers. This helps you understand data flow and identify potential memory leaks or unexpected dependencies.

## Timeline

The **Timeline** acts as a logger for state changes. It records every signal update with a timestamp, allowing you to trace exactly when and why your application state changed.

## Global Error Boundary

`FluxyApp` includes a built-in **Global Error Boundary**. This feature automatically catches unhandled exceptions in your widget tree, preventing the entire application from crashing in production. Instead, it displays a user-friendly error screen (which you can customize) while logging the error details for debugging.
