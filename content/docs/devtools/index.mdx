# Fluxy DevTools

Fluxy provides a suite of tools not just for debugging, but for **active stability management**.

## 1. The Stability Engine (Layout Guard)

Fluxy's standout feature is its **Layout Guard**, which wraps your app and intercepts common Flutter layout errors (like `RenderFlex overflowed` or `Vertical viewport was given unbounded height`).

### Strict vs. Relaxed Mode

Fluxy operates in two modes:

1.  **Relaxed Mode (Default)**: Use this in **Production**.
    -   **Auto-Fix**: If a widget overflows, Fluxy attempts to fix it automatically (e.g., by wrapping it in a scroll view or clipping it).
    -   **No Crashes**: The user sees a slightly adjusted UI instead of a "Grey Screen of Death".
    -   **Logs**: Errors are logged silently to your analytics service.

2.  **Strict Mode**: Use this in **Development**.
    -   **Crash Immediately**: Fluxy throws a loud exception when a layout rule is violated.
    -   **Red Screen**: Visual feedback ensures you fix the bug before shipping.

```dart
void main() {
  // Enable strict mode for dev builds
  Fluxy.setStrictMode(kDebugMode); 
  
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### Layout Detection

The Guard automatically detects:
-   **Infinite Height**: `Column` inside `ListView`.
-   **Unbounded Width**: `Row` expanding infinitely.
-   **Render Siver Errors**: Mixing box and sliver widgets incorrectly.

## 2. Visual Layout Inspector

Wrap your app root to enable the visual inspector overlay.

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    Fluxy.debug(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

-   **Toggle Inspector**: Shake device or press the on-screen generic button.
-   **Highlight Overflows**: Draws red boxes around widgets that are clipping or overflowing.
-   **Repaint Rainbow**: visualized via standard Flutter tools, but Fluxy integrates shortcuts.

## 3. Stability Metrics

View a summary of how many crashes Fluxy has prevented in the current session.

```dart
Fluxy.printStabilitySummary();
```

**Output:**
```
[Fluxy Stability] Session Report:
- Prevented Crashes: 3
- Layout Repairs: 12
- Active Guards: 5
```

## 4. Network & State Logging

While Fluxy works with any client, `Fluxy.http` provides built-in logging.

```dart
// Enable verbose network logs
Fluxy.http.enableLogs = true;
```

State changes in `flux()` variables can also be traced:

```dart
final count = flux(0, name: 'Counter');
// Logs: [Flux] Counter changed: 0 -> 1
```

By leveraging these tools, you ensure your app is not just "bug-free" but **resilient** to unexpected runtime conditions.
