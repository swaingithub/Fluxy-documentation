# Cloud Builds [EXPERIMENTAL]

<Callout type="warn" title="Experimental Feature">
  Cloud Builds integration is currently in **Alpha**. GitHub Actions workflows may require manual adjustment. The command interface is subject to change.
</Callout>

Fluxy integrates directly with GitHub Actions to provide zero-cost CI/CD for your Flutter apps.

## Setup

Run the following command to generate a GitHub Actions workflow file:

```bash
fluxy cloud setup
```

This creates a `.github/workflows/fluxy_build.yml` file in your repository.

## Triggering a Build

Pushing to the `main` branch or creating a tag will trigger a build.

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The workflow will automatically:

1.  Set up Flutter environment.
2.  Install dependencies.
3.  Run tests.
4.  Build Android APK/AppBundle.
5.  Build iOS IPA (requires macOS runner).
6.  Upload artifacts to GitHub Releases.

## Artifacts

Once the build is complete, you can download the APKs and IPAs directly from the GitHub Actions run summary or Releases page.
