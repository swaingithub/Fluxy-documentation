# Workspace Authority

For teams and developers building modular ecosystems, Fluxy provides a **Standardized Workspace Environment**. This system ensures that 15+ modules can be managed, tested, and published with zero friction.

## The Monorepo Architecture

Fluxy workspaces use an industry-standard monorepo structure. This allows you to develop the core engine and multiple plugins (like `fluxy_auth` or `fluxy_storage`) in a single repository while keeping them logically separated.

### Structure:
```text
/
├── packages/          # All Fluxy plugins (auth, storage, etc.)
├── example/           # Demo application
├── melos.yaml         # Workspace configuration
├── analysis_options.yaml # Global quality standards
└── pubspec.yaml       # Root management file
```

## Melos Integration

Fluxy uses **Melos** to provide a "Branded Command Center." Instead of managing each package manually, you use the `fluxy melos` prefix to run commands across the entire workspace.

### 1. Bootstrapping
Connects all local packages together so they can resolve each other without needing to be published to Pub.dev first.
```powershell
fluxy melos bootstrap
```

### 2. Industry Standard Analysis
Scans every single file in the workspace against the **High-Performance Linting Rules**.
```powershell
fluxy melos run analyze
```

### 3. Global Testing
Runs all unit and widget tests across every module to ensure no regressions.
```powershell
fluxy melos run test
```

## Industry Standard Quality

Fluxy workspaces enforce a strict `analysis_options.yaml` at the root level. This ensures that every module—no matter how small—adheres to the same professional standards:

- **Immutability**: Enforces `const` constructors for performance.
- **Safety**: Prevents unawaited futures and potential memory leaks.
- **Consistency**: Standardizes member ordering and naming conventions.

---

## Unified CI/CD

Every Fluxy workspace comes with pre-configured **GitHub Actions**. This is your automated "Safety Net."

Located at `.github/workflows/verify.yml`, it automatically:
1.  **Bootstraps** the workspace on a clean environment.
2.  **Analyzes** the code for linting violations.
3.  **Tests** every module to ensure architectural integrity.

> [!TIP]
> This workflow ensures that a change in the `fluxy` core engine never accidentally breaks the `fluxy_auth` or `fluxy_storage` plugins.

## Hardened Auth (Standard)

The `fluxy_auth` plugin has been upgraded to **Industrial Grade Security**. 
- **Encryption**: Uses `flutter_secure_storage` with hardware-backed encryption (KeyStore/Keychain).
- **Session Persistence**: Automatically restores user sessions on app restarts via the `onRegister` lifecycle hook.
