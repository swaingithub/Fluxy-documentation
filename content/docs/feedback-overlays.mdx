# Feedback & Overlays

Fluxy v0.1.4 introduces a **Context-Free** overlay system. You can now trigger toasts, dialogs, and loaders from anywhere in your code — including controllers and services — without needing a `BuildContext` reference.

> **Technical Requirement**: To use context-free overlays, ensure that `FluxyRouter.navigatorKey` is attached to your `MaterialApp`.

```dart
MaterialApp(
  navigatorKey: FluxyRouter.navigatorKey,
  // ...
)
```

## Toasts

Toasts are non-intrusive messages that appear at the bottom (or top) of the screen. Fluxy provides semantic methods for different notification types.

### Success Toast
```dart
Fx.toast.success("Profile updated successfully!");
```

### Error Toast
```dart
Fx.toast.error("Failed to save changes. Please try again.");
```

### Info & Warning
```dart
Fx.toast.info("A new update is available.");
// or
Fx.toast.warning("Your session is about to expire.");
```

## Loaders

Manage global loading states with simple show/hide commands. This is perfect for blocking the UI during critical network operations.

```dart
// Show the loader
Fx.loader.show();

// Perform async operation
await saveToServer();

// Hide the loader
Fx.loader.hide();
```

## Dialogs

Prompt the user for decisions or display critical alerts with ease.

### Confirm Dialog
Returns a `Future<bool>` indicating the user's choice.

```dart
final confirmed = await Fx.dialog.confirm(
  title: "Delete Account",
  message: "Are you sure you want to proceed? This action cannot be undone.",
  confirmText: "Delete",
  cancelText: "Keep it",
);

if (confirmed) {
  // Proceed with deletion
}
```

### Alert Dialog
A simple modal for displaying information that requires acknowledgment.

```dart
await Fx.dialog.alert(
  title: "Permission Required",
  message: "Please enable camera access in your settings.",
);
```

## Why Context-Free?

Traditional Flutter overlays require a `BuildContext`, which often forces you to pass the context down through multiple layers of widgets or logic. By moving to a **Managed Overlay State**, Fluxy allows your business logic (Controllers) to trigger UI feedback directly, adhering to a cleaner "Context-Free" architecture.
