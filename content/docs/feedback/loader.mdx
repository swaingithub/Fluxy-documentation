# FxLoader

`FxLoader` is a global loading overlay designed to be shown during critical operations, such as network requests or database transactions.

## Usage

```dart
Fx.loader.show();

await api.login();

Fx.loader.hide();
```

## Features

### Context-Free Blocking
The loader is rendered on the `Overlay` stack, meaning it can be shown from anywhere in your logic without needing a widget tree reference.

### Customizability
You can override the default spinner with your own loading widget.

```dart
Fx.loader.setWidget(MyLottieSpinner());
```
