# Fluxy Play

Fluxy Play is a REPL-like environment for prototyping and experimentation. It allows you to run Fluxy code snippets without compiling a full Flutter application.

## Usage

```bash
fluxy play
```

This starts a local development server or opens a web playground (if available) where you can write ephemeral Dart code.

## Cloud Playground

Visit `play.fluxy.dev` (Coming Soon) to share executable snippets online.

## Use Cases

*   Quickly test a `Signal` logic.
*   Experiment with `Fx` layouts.
*   Share code snippets with peers.
