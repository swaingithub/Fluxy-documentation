# Fluxy CLI

The Fluxy CLI facilitates project scaffolding, accelerated development, and cloud integration. It is designed to automate the heavy lifting of project management and DevOps.

## Installation

Install the Fluxy CLI globally via Dart:

```bash
dart pub global activate fluxy
```

## Core Commands

### `fluxy init <app_name>`

Scaffolds a new Fluxy project with the official architecture, boilerplate, and pre-configured state management.

```bash
fluxy init my_awesome_app
```

### `fluxy run`

The optimized development runner for Fluxy projects. It provides faster hot-reloads and environment-specific optimizations compared to standard runners.

```bash
fluxy run
```

### `fluxy doctor`

Checks your environment for Flutter and Fluxy compatibility and reports potential issues.

```bash
fluxy doctor
```

### `fluxy serve`

Launches a local Over-The-Air (OTA) server for instant development and testing of remote manifests. This allows you to test SDUI (Server-Driven UI) changes locally before deploying.

```bash
fluxy serve
```

## Cloud Integration

Fluxy CLI provides built-in tools for CI/CD and cloud-based build systems.

### `fluxy cloud build <android|ios>`

Automatically configures GitHub Actions and cloud build environments for automated builds. It handles signing configurations and dependency management.

```bash
fluxy cloud build android
```

### `fluxy cloud deploy`

Sets up and executes automated deployment pipelines to TestFlight (iOS) and Google Play (Android). It automates the submission process and metadata management.

```bash
fluxy cloud deploy
```

## Generators & Blueprints

Generate components and boilerplate quickly to maintain project consistency.

### `fluxy g <name> <type>` (Blueprints)

Generates complete, working feature solutions based on official **Blueprints**. Currently supports professional scaffolding for common features.

```bash
# Generate a complete login feature
fluxy g auth login

# Generate a social feed feature
fluxy g social feed
```

### `fluxy g:page <Name>`

Generates a new View, Controller, and Route entry.

```bash
fluxy g:page Home
```

### `fluxy g:controller <Name>`

Generates a standalone reactive controller for global or modular state.

```bash
fluxy g:controller Auth
```

### `fluxy generate plugin <Name>`

Generates a new framework plugin (extension) scaffold following the `FluxyPlugin` architecture.

```bash
fluxy generate plugin MyAnalytics
```

### `fluxy generate layout <Name>`

Generates a reusable layout template for organizing complex UI structures.

```bash
fluxy generate layout Dashboard
```

### `fluxy generate model <Name>`

Generates a data model with built-in JSON serialization and reactive properties.

```bash
fluxy generate model UserProfile
```
