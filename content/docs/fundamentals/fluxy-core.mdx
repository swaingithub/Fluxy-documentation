# The Fluxy Class

`Fluxy` is the central nervous system of your application. It acts as a **Global Service Locator**, **Navigation Hub**, and **Configuration Center**.

Instead of importing dozens of packages for routing, DI, and networking, you access them all through this single static class.

## Initialization

You must initialize Fluxy at the start of your app's `main()` function. This boots up the dependency injection, storage, and plugin systems.

```dart
void main() async {
  // 1. Initialize Core Services
  await Fluxy.init();
  
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

## Navigation Shortcuts

Fluxy provides a context-free navigation API, allowing you to navigate from anywhere (even inside Controllers).

```dart
// Navigate to a route
Fluxy.to('/details', arguments: {'id': 123});

// Navigate and replace current route (e.g., Login -> Home)
Fluxy.off('/home');

// Navigate and clear entire stack (e.g., Logout)
Fluxy.offAll('/login');

// Go back
Fluxy.back();
```

## Dependency Injection (DI)

Manage your app's dependencies with a simple key-value store.

```dart
// Register a dependency
Fluxy.put(AuthService());

// Lazy load (only created when first used)
Fluxy.lazyPut(() => UserController());

// Retrieve a dependency
final auth = Fluxy.find<AuthService>();
```

## Networking

Access the globally configured `FluxyHttp` client.

```dart
// GET request
final response = await Fluxy.http.get('/users/1');

// POST request
await Fluxy.http.post('/login', data: {'email': '...'});
```

## Plugins & Configuration

### Registering Plugins
Extend Fluxy's capabilities by registering plugins before initialization.

```dart
Fluxy.register(MyAnalyticsPlugin());
await Fluxy.init();
```

### Strict Mode (Layout)
Enable strict mode during development to catch layout errors immediately.

```dart
Fluxy.setStrictMode(true);
```

### Stability Metrics
View a summary of how many crashes Fluxy has prevented in the current session.

```dart
Fluxy.printStabilitySummary();
```

## Debugging

Wrap your root widget in `Fluxy.debug` to enable the visual inspector overlay.

```dart
runApp(
  Fluxy.debug(child: MyApp())
);
```
