# Reactivity

Fluxy's reactivity is built on three main primitives: **Flux**, **FluxComputed**, and **FluxEffect**.

## Flux (`flux`)

`flux` creates a **mutable signal**. Flux units are containers for values that can change over time.

```dart
final count = flux(0);

// Set value
count.value = 5;

// Read value (creates a dependency)
print(count.value);
```

When you read a signal inside a reactive context (like an `effect` or a `Fx` widget builder), that context automatically subscribes to the signal.

## FluxComputed

`fluxComputed` creates a **derived signal** that depends on other flux units.

```dart
final count = flux(0);
final doubleCount = fluxComputed(() => count.value * 2);
```

`doubleCount` will automatically update whenever `count` updates. It is lazily evaluated and cached. It will only recompute when its value is accessed or when its dependencies change.

## FluxEffect

`fluxEffect` runs a function immediately and re-runs it whenever any of its dependencies change.

```dart
fluxEffect(() {
  print("Count is now: ${count.value}");
});
```

This is useful for side effects like logging, manual DOM updates, or triggering network requests.

## Reactivity in UI

To make your UI reactive, you have two primary options:

### The `Fx` Factory
Wrap any widget builder in `Fx(() => ...)` to automatically subscribe to any signals used inside. This triggers atomic rebuilds only for that specific widget.

```dart
final count = flux(0);

// Only this Text widget rebuilds when count changes
Fx(() => Text("Count: ${count.value}")) 
```

### Reactive Text Shorthand
For simple text display, use `Fx.text(() => signal.value)`.

```dart
Fx.text(() => "Current: ${count.value}");
```

## Two-Way Binding

Fluxy v0.1.4 provides native two-way binding for interactive components. Instead of manually handling `onChanged` and `controller.text`, you can bind a signal directly.

### FxTextField
Binds its text content to a `Signal<String>`.

```dart
final username = flux("");

FxTextField(
  label: "Username",
  value: username, // Two-way binding
)
```

### FxDropdown
Binds its selection to a `Signal<T>`.

```dart
final theme = flux("Light");

FxDropdown<String>(
  value: theme, // Two-way binding
  options: ["Light", "Dark", "System"],
)
```

### Automatic Cleanup
Effects and subscriptions created within a widget's lifecycle are automatically disposed of when the widget is destroyed, preventing memory leaks.
