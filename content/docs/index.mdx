# Fluxy v0.1.2
**One Engine. Infinite Possibilities.**

Fluxy is a "Full-Stack" Flutter platform designed to modernize mobile and web development. It unifies high-performance Signals-based reactivity, an Atomic Styling DSL (Fluent interface), and Cloud-based CI/CD into a single, cohesive engine.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-8">
  <div className="p-4 border rounded-lg bg-card text-card-foreground">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Atomic Styling DSL</h3>
    <p>Chainable modifiers for any widget. Shorthand syntax like `.px(16).py(8).bg.blue500` for lightning-fast UI construction using the new Proxy-based DSL.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 border rounded-lg bg-card text-card-foreground">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Signals Reactivity</h3>
    <p>Fine-grained updates via `flux(value)`. Use `Fx(() => widget)` for automatic atomic rebuilds without the boilerplate.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 border rounded-lg bg-card text-card-foreground">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Premium Widget Suite</h3>
    <p>High-quality, pre-styled widgets like `FxAvatar`, `FxBadge`, `FxDropdown`, and the physics-based `FxBottomBar`.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 border rounded-lg bg-card text-card-foreground">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">OTA & SDUI</h3>
    <p>Render remote JSON manifests via `FxRemoteView`. Update your app instantly with Over-The-Air capabilities.</p>
  </div>

## The Fluxy Philosophy

Fluxy isn't just a state management library; it's an **all-in-one Flutter ecosystem**. 

Traditional Flutter development often requires stitching together multiple packages: one for state, one for navigation, and one for styling. Fluxy provides all of these as first-class citizens, integrated into a single **Reactive Engine** that minimizes boilerplate and maximizes flow.

### v0.1.2 Highlights

- **Proxy-based DSL**: More intuitive syntax like `.weight.bold` and `.bg.blue500` instead of just method calls.
- **Atomic DSL Shorthands**: Use `.p()`, `.m()`, `.bg()`, `.rounded()`, and more for rapid styling.
- **Cloud Orchestration**: Integrated commands for GitHub Actions based CI/CD.
- **Ready for Production**: Core engines (Signals, DSL, OTA) are now production-ready in Alpha.
