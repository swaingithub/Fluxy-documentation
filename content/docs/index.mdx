# Fluxy v0.1.7
**One Engine. Infinite Possibilities.**

Fluxy is a "Full-Stack" Flutter platform designed to modernize mobile and web development. It unifies high-performance Signals-based reactivity, an Atomic Styling DSL (Fluent interface), and Cloud-based CI/CD into a single, cohesive engine.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-8">
  <div className="p-4 border rounded-lg bg-card text-card-foreground">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Atomic Styling DSL</h3>
    <p>Chainable modifiers for any widget. Shorthand syntax like `.px(16).py(8).bg.blue500` for lightning-fast UI construction.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 border rounded-lg bg-card text-card-foreground">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Signals Reactivity</h3>
    <p>Fine-grained updates via `flux(value)`. Use `Fx(() => widget)` for automatic atomic rebuilds without the boilerplate.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 border rounded-lg bg-card text-card-foreground">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Premium Widget Suite</h3>
    <p>High-quality components like `FxTable`, `FxGrid`, `FxForm`, and the physics-based `FxBottomBar`.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 border rounded-lg bg-card text-card-foreground">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">OTA & SDUI</h3>
    <p>Render remote JSON manifests via `FxRemoteView`. Update your app instantly with Over-The-Air capabilities.</p>
  </div>

## The Fluxy Philosophy

Fluxy isn't just a state management library; it's an **all-in-one Flutter ecosystem**. 

Traditional Flutter development often requires stitching together multiple packages: one for state, one for navigation, and one for styling. Fluxy provides all of these as first-class citizens, integrated into a single **Reactive Engine** that minimizes boilerplate and maximizes flow.

### v0.1.7 Highlights

- **Atomic Interaction API**: Expressive buttonizers for strings and widgets (`"Save".primaryBtn()`).
- **Visual FX Engine**: Native modifiers for `.blur()`, `.grayscale()`, and `.circle()`.
- **Chainable Transitions**: Smooth interpolation of styles via `.transition(Duration)`.
- **Sequence DSL**: Unified `.stagger()` animations for rows and columns.
- **Enhanced Motion**: Looping and repeating animations for attention-grabbing effects.

### v0.1.6 Highlights

- **Declarative Conditionals**: Render UI states cleaner with `Fx.cond()`.
- **Intelligent Spacing**: Independent gap widgets (`Fx.gap`, `Fx.hgap`) for precise layouts.
- **Enhanced Inputs**: Multi-function validators and better formatting for `Fx.input`.
- **Next-Gen Layouts**: Explicit `Fx.row`, `Fx.col`, and `Fx.stack` with standard parameters.
