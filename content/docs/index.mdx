# Introduction

Fluxy is a modern, high-performance Flutter framework designed to simplify UI development and state management. It brings atomic reactivity and a fluent DSL to Flutter, reducing boilerplate and making your code more expressive.

## Why Fluxy?

Traditional Flutter development often involves deeply nested widget trees and complex state management patterns. Fluxy changes this by providing:

- **Atomic Reactivity**: Only rebuild what's necessary. No more `setState` at the top of your tree.
- **Fluent DSL**: A clean, chainable API for building UIs that feels natural and readable.
- **High Performance**: Optimized rendering engine that minimizes layout and paint cycles.
- **Developer Experience**: Less code, more features, and a faster feedback loop.

## Quick Preview

```dart
final count = Signal(0);

Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Fx.column()
    .children([
      Fx.text("Count: ${count.value}").size(24).bold().render(),
      Fx.button("Increment")
        .onPressed(() => count.value++)
        .padding(16)
        .render(),
    ])
    .center()
    .render();
}
```
