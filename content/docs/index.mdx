# Fluxy
**One Engine. Infinite Possibilities.**

Fluxy is a full-stack Flutter Framework designed to be the definitive solution for modern application development. It unifies state management, UI construction, routing, and DevOps into a single, cohesive engine.

## The Fluxy Philosophy

Fluxy isn't just a state management library; it's an **application architecture**. 

Traditional Flutter development often requires stitching together multiple packages: one for state (Riverpod/Bloc), one for navigation (GoRouter), one for styling, and another for networking. Fluxy provides all of these as first-class citizens, integrated into a single **Reactive Engine**.

### Key Features

- **Signals & Effects**: The core of Fluxy's reactivity.
- **Fx Namespace**: A unified entry point for all UI elements (`Fx.text`, `Fx.box`).
- **Typed Routing**: Type-safe navigation with middleware support.
- **CLI Tooling**: Generators and build tools to speed up your workflow.
