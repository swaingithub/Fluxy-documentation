# Installation

Fluxy is composed of two main parts: the **CLI** for orchestration and the **Framework** for building. In **v0.2.5 (The Platform Era)**, Fluxy transitions to a module-based platform architecture.

## 1. Install Fluxy CLI

The Fluxy CLI handles project scaffolding, module management, and local OTA testing.

```bash
dart pub global activate fluxy
```

## 2. Initialize a New Project

If you are starting from scratch, use the CLI to scaffold a complete Fluxy architecture:

```bash
fluxy init my_awesome_app
```

## 3. Add Framework to Existing Project

If you already have a Flutter project, add the Fluxy framework via `pub.dev`.

```bash
flutter pub add fluxy
```

Alternatively, add it manually to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fluxy: ^0.2.5
```

## Basic Setup

Import Fluxy in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:fluxy/fluxy.dart';
```

## Global Initialization

In the Platform Era, initialization is two-fold: setting up the core engine and auto-registering installed modules.

```dart
void main() async {
  // 1. Initialize Fluxy Engine
  await Fluxy.init(); 
  
  // 2. Auto-register Platform Modules
  // This wires up all installed modules (auth, storage, etc.) automatically.
  Fluxy.autoRegister();
  
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

## The Module Paradigm

Instead of just "plugins", Fluxy now uses **Platform Modules**. You can add them using the new CLI command:

```bash
fluxy module add auth
fluxy module add storage
```

This command handles installation and ensures they are picked up by `Fluxy.autoRegister()`.

## Wrapping your App

We recommend using `FluxyApp` (a pre-configured `MaterialApp`) or `Fx` builders for the best experience:

```dart
void main() async {
  await Fluxy.init();
  Fluxy.autoRegister();
  
  runApp(
    FluxyApp(
      title: "My App",
      initialRoute: HomeRoute(),
      routes: [HomeRoute(), SettingsRoute()],
    ),
  );
}
```

Now you're ready to start building with the Fluxy Platform!
