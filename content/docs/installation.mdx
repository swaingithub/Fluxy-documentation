# Installation

Fluxy v1.0.0 introduces a revolutionary modular architecture. Install only the packages you need for your specific use case.

## 1. Install Core Framework

The Fluxy core provides the Fluxy State System and essential building blocks.

```bash
dart pub add fluxy
```

## 2. Add Optional Modules

Fluxy's modular architecture lets you add only what you need:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fluxy: ^1.0.0                    # Core framework with Fluxy State System
  fluxy_auth: ^1.0.0                # Authentication & biometrics
  fluxy_camera: ^1.0.0              # Camera functionality  
  fluxy_notifications: ^1.0.0         # Push notifications
  fluxy_storage: ^1.0.0               # Data persistence
  # ... add only modules you use
```

## 3. Initialize a New Project

For a complete Fluxy architecture with all modules, use the CLI:

```bash
fluxy init my_awesome_app
```

## 3. Add Framework to Existing Project

If you already have a Flutter project, add the Fluxy framework via `pub.dev`.

```bash
flutter pub add fluxy
```

Alternatively, add it manually to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fluxy: ^1.0.0
```

### Modular Packages (v1.0.0)

With v1.0.0, Fluxy introduces a modular architecture. Add only the packages you need:

```yaml
dependencies:
  # Core Framework
  fluxy: ^1.0.0
  
  # Add modules as needed
  fluxy_forms: ^1.0.0        # Forms and validation
  fluxy_camera: ^1.0.0       # Camera functionality  
  fluxy_auth: ^1.0.0         # Authentication and biometrics
  fluxy_notifications: ^1.0.0 # Push notifications
  fluxy_storage: ^1.0.0      # Data persistence
```

### Migration from v0.2.6

If you're upgrading from v0.2.6, you'll need to:

1. Update your `pubspec.yaml` to use modular packages
2. Add the specific packages you need
3. Update import statements if using modular features

**[Read Migration Guide](https://github.com/swaingithub/fluxy/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)**

## Basic Setup

Import Fluxy in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:fluxy/fluxy.dart';
```

## Global Initialization

In the Platform Era, initialization is two-fold: setting up the core engine and auto-registering installed modules.

```dart
void main() async {
  // 1. Initialize Fluxy Engine
  await Fluxy.init(); 
  
  // 2. Auto-register Platform Modules
  // This wires up all installed modules (auth, storage, etc.) automatically.
  Fluxy.autoRegister();
  
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

## The Module Paradigm

Instead of just "plugins", Fluxy now uses **Platform Modules**. You can add them using the new CLI command:

```bash
fluxy module add auth
fluxy module add storage
```

This command handles installation and ensures they are picked up by `Fluxy.autoRegister()`.

## Wrapping your App

We recommend using `FluxyApp` (a pre-configured `MaterialApp`) or `Fx` builders for the best experience:

```dart
void main() async {
  await Fluxy.init();
  Fluxy.autoRegister();
  
  runApp(
    FluxyApp(
      title: "My App",
      initialRoute: HomeRoute(),
      routes: [HomeRoute(), SettingsRoute()],
    ),
  );
}
```

Now you're ready to start building with the Fluxy Platform!

## Workspace & Monorepo Setup

If you are developing a modular ecosystem with multiple local packages, you should use the **Workspace Authority** tools:

1. **Activate Melos (Industrial Management)**
   ```bash
   dart pub global activate melos
   ```

2. **Bootstrap the Workspace**
   Connects all local modules (`auth`, `storage`, etc.) together:
   ```bash
   fluxy melos bootstrap
   ```

3. **Verify Integrity**
   Run the global analysis and test suite:
   ```bash
   fluxy melos run analyze
   fluxy melos run test
   ```

For more details on managing multiple packages, see the **[Workspace Authority](/docs/ecosystem/workspace-authority)** guide.
