# Installation

Fluxy is composed of two main parts: the **CLI** for orchestration and the **Framework** for building.

## 1. Install Fluxy CLI

The Fluxy CLI handles project scaffolding, feature generation (Blueprints), and local OTA testing.

```bash
dart pub global activate fluxy
```

## 2. Initialize a New Project

If you are starting from scratch, use the CLI to scaffold a complete Fluxy architecture:

```bash
fluxy init my_awesome_app
```

## 3. Add Framework to Existing Project

If you already have a Flutter project, add the Fluxy framework via `pub.dev`.

```bash
flutter pub add fluxy
```

Alternatively, add it manually to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fluxy: ^0.2.0
```

## Basic Setup

Import Fluxy in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:fluxy/fluxy.dart';
```

## Global Initialization

Starting from v0.1.8, you must initialize the Fluxy engine at the start of your `main()` function. This handles framework setup, state hydration, and networking orchestration.

```dart
void main() async {
  // 1. Ensure Flutter is initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // 2. Initialize Fluxy Engine
  await Fluxy.init(); 
  
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

## Wrapping your App (Optional)

While `Fluxy.init()` handles the core engine, wrapping your app with `FluxyRoot` provides additional context-aware features like global overlays and theme management:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Fluxy.init();
  
  runApp(
    FluxyRoot(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

Now you're ready to start building with Fluxy!
