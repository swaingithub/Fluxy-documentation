# Installation

Getting started with Fluxy is simple. You can add it to your project via `pub.dev`.

## Add Dependency

Add `fluxy` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fluxy: ^0.1.2
```

Or run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter pub add fluxy
```

## Basic Setup

Import Fluxy in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:fluxy/fluxy.dart';
```

## Wrapping your App

For global state and context-aware features, it's recommended to wrap your app with `FluxyRoot`:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    FluxyRoot(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

Now you're ready to start building with Fluxy!
