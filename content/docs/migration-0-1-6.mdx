# Fluxy 0.1.5 → 0.1.6 Migration Guide

Fluxy 0.1.6 is a "Trust & Stability" release focused on hardening the internal architecture while keeping the outward-facing DSL consistent. While most changes are internal, there are a few key refinements to be aware of.

## 🚀 Key Architectural Shift: Attribute Accumulation

Previously, Fluxy used a "Widget Wrapping" approach where every modifier call (like `.padding()`) would wrap the widget in another physical widget (like `Padding`).

In **0.1.6**, Fluxy has transitioned to an **Attribute Accumulation** model. Modifiers now update a local style object within the source widget.

### Why this matters:
1. **Performance**: Your widget tree is now significantly flatter. Chaining 10 modifiers results in exactly **one** styled widget.
2. **Correctness**: Fixed the "Incorrect use of ParentDataWidget" error. Modifiers now correctly preserve `Expanded`, `Flexible`, and `Positioned` data.
3. **Consistency**: All core widgets now behave identically when styled.

## 🛠 Breaking Changes & Deprecations

### 1. Removal of ``
The `` method is no longer required and has been removed from the engine. Fluxy widgets are now actual `Widget` instances from the start of the chain.

**Action**: Remove all `` calls from your widget chains.
```dart
// Old (0.1.5)
Fx.box().p(16).bg(Colors.blue);

// New (0.1.6)
Fx.box().p(16).bg(Colors.blue)
```

### 2. Proxy DSL Syntax Updates
Property proxies like `bold` and `italic` are now **getters**, not methods.

**Action**: Remove parentheses from these property proxies.
```dart
// Old (0.1.5)
Fx.text("Hi").font.lg.bold()

// New (0.1.6)
Fx.text("Hi").font.lg.bold
```

### 3. Fx.cond Parameter Shift
`Fx.cond` now reactive by default and expects a **Signal** rather than a boolean value.

**Action**: Pass the signal directly, without `.value`.
```dart
// Old (0.1.5)
Fx.cond(isLoading.value, loadingWidget, dataWidget)

// New (0.1.6)
Fx.cond(isLoading, loadingWidget, dataWidget)
```

### 4. Factory Method Signatures
The `Fx` factory methods (avatar, table, dropdown, badge) now support the accumulation pattern natively via named parameters.

```dart
// Native support for style and class names in constructors
Fx.avatar(
  image: "...", 
  style: FxStyle(padding: 10), 
  className: "profile-pic",
  responsive: true,
)
```

## ✅ Best Practices for 0.1.6

### Use ClassNames for Shared Styles
With the new engine, `className` is resolved **after** the inline `.style()` but **before** modifiers. This means modifiers will always override class-based styles.

### Modifier Order
Because styles are now accumulated into a single object, the order of most modifiers no longer affects the result. `.padding(10).bg(Colors.blue)` is identical to `.bg(Colors.blue).padding(10)`.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"My ParentData is still breaking!"**
Ensure you are using the latest `Fx` factories. If you are wrapping a native Flutter widget in `Expanded`, make sure the `Expanded` is the **outermost** element in your DSL chain, or use the `.expand()` modifier directly.

**"Shadows look different!"**
We fixed a recursion bug where multiple shadows were stacking incorrectly. Your UI might look "cleaner" now. Adjust your shadow blur values if necessary.
