# Fluxy 0.1.6 → 0.1.7 Migration Guide

Fluxy 0.1.7 introduces the **Atomic Interaction API**, a major upgrade to the button system, alongside powerful new visual filters and motion enhancements. This release focuses on "Interaction Fidelity" and "Visual Polish".

## Key Features

### 1. Atomic Interaction API (Next-Gen Buttons)
The `FxButton` system has been completely re-engineered. Buttons now use a **content-first architecture**, ensuring perfect centering and flexible layout options.

- **Expressive Buttonizers**: You can now turn any `String` or `Widget` into a button directly using `.primaryBtn()`, `.secondaryBtn()`, or `.btn()`.
- **Custom Content Injection**: Use the `.withChild()` modifier to inject complex layouts into buttons.

### 2. Premium Visual FX Engine
New native modifiers for images and generic widgets:
- `.blur(radius)`: Apply high-performance gaussian blur.
- `.grayscale()`: Instantly desaturate any widget or image.
- `.circle()`: Professional-grade circular clipping with optimized anti-aliasing.

### 3. Chainable Transitions
The new `.transition(Duration)` modifier allows for automatic interpolation of style changes. When properties like `background` or `padding` change due to state, Fluxy will now smoothly animate the transition.

## Breaking Changes & Deprecations

### 1. FxButton Internal Centering
We renamed some internal properties to avoid collisions. If you were using custom `FxButton` implementations that relied on internal layout fields, you might need to update them.

**Recommendation**: Use the new `.withChild()` or standard label-based buttons.

### 2. FxBadge Parent Container Fix
In 0.1.6, styling applied to an `FxBadge` sometimes leaked into the notification dot. In 0.1.7, these styles are correctly applied to the **parent container**.

**Action**: Check your `FxBadge` instances. If you were relying on the "leaked" styles for the dot, you should now use the badge-specific parameters for styling the dot.

## Best Practices for 0.1.7

### Use `.primaryBtn()` for Strings
Instead of `Fx.primaryButton("Save")`, use the more concise:
```dart
"Save".primaryBtn(onTap: () => save())
```

### Automatic Image Shimmers
You no longer need to manually add shimmers to network images. `Fx.loader.shimmer()` is now the default loading engine for `Fx.image`.

### Staggered Row/Col Animations
Use the `.stagger(interval)` modifier on `Fx.row` and `Fx.col` to create professional entrance animations with a single line of code.

```dart
Fx.col().children([...]).stagger(100.ms)
```

## Troubleshooting

**"My button content isn't centered!"**
0.1.7 fixed a centering engine bug. If you had "hacks" (like manual padding) to center button content in 0.1.6, those hacks may now cause off-center layout. Remove them to let the new engine handle it.

**"Transition isn't firing!"**
Ensure the modifier that triggers the style change is called *before* or *after* the `.transition()` modifier. Transition builds a "tweening" wrapper around the accumulated style.
