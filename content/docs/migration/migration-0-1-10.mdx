# Migration to v0.1.10

Fluxy v0.1.10 introduces stability improvements, blueprint polish, and a breaking change in how font sizes are accessed in the Styling DSL.

## Breaking Changes

### Font Proxy: Getters to Methods

To ensure stable chaining and prevent runtime invocation errors, font size proxies have been reverted from **getters** to **methods**. You must now invoke font sizes with parentheses.

**Before (v0.1.9):**
```dart
Fx.text("Hello")
  .font.lg.bold // 'lg' was a getter
```

**After (v0.1.10+):**
```dart
Fx.text("Hello")
  .font.lg().bold // 'lg' is now a method
```

**Impacted Tokens:**
- `xs()`, `sm()`, `md()`, `lg()`, `xl()`, `xl2()`, `xl3()`, `xl4()`, `xl5()`, `xl6()`

---

## New Features

### Expanded Typography

Three new font size tokens have been added to the design system:
- `xl4()`: Extra large 4 (Title scale)
- `xl5()`: Extra large 5 (Display scale)
- `xl6()`: Extra large 6 (Hero scale)

New text modifiers:
- `.italic()`: Apply italic style.
- `.letterSpacing(double)`: Semantically adjust spacing between letters.

## Stability Fixes

- **OTA Engine**: Fixed an issue where the core OTA/SDUI engine files were accidentally excluded from the package distribution.
- **Blueprint Polish**: Reverted property getters back to methods in login/feed blueprints to ensure stability.
- **Type Safety**: Fixed type-mismatch errors in the `feed` blueprint.

## Recommended Upgrade Path

1. Update your `pubspec.yaml` to `fluxy: ^0.1.10`.
2. Run `flutter pub get`.
3. Global search for `.font.` in your codebase and add `()` to all size tokens (e.g., `.font.md` -> `.font.md()`).
