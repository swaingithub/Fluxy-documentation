# Migration to v0.1.11

Fluxy v0.1.11 focuses on **Routing & DI Stabilization**, automating the registration of controllers defined within your route tree.

## New Features

### Automatic Route DI

The biggest improvement in v0.1.11 is the automatic registration and disposal of controllers defined within `FxRoute`. You no longer need to manually call `FluxyDI.put()` or `FluxyDI.delete()` for these controllers.

**Before:**
```dart
FxRoute(
  path: '/profile',
  builder: (context) => ProfilePage(),
  controller: (context) {
    final c = ProfileController();
    FluxyDI.put(c); // Manual registration
    return c;
  },
)
```

**After:**
```dart
FxRoute(
  path: '/profile',
  builder: (context) => ProfilePage(),
  controller: (context) => ProfileController(), // Auto-registered by framework
)
```

## Stability Fixes

- **DI Engine**: Improved internal framework orchestration with `putByRuntimeType` and `deleteByRuntimeType`.
- **Exception Handling**: Fixed `FluxyDIException` where controllers in `FxRoute` weren't being correctly initialized during deep-linking.

## Recommended Upgrade Path

1. Update your `pubspec.yaml` to `fluxy: ^0.1.11`.
2. Run `flutter pub get`.
3. Simplify your `FxRoute` definitions by removing manual `FluxyDI.put` calls from the `controller` factory.
