# Migration to v0.2.1

Fluxy v0.2.1 is a significant refinement release that fixes common DevTools initialization errors and introduces powerful new debugging capabilities.

## Major Changes

### 1. DevTools Power-Up
- **Search & Filter**: You can now search through your fluxes by name or ID. This is essential for large applications with hundreds of state objects.
- **Live Value Editing**: The inspector now allows you to change values of `bool`, `String`, and `num` fluxes directly from the UI. This allows for immediate testing of UI states without recompiling.

### 2. Branding: Flux vs. Signal
The DevTools and documentation have transitioned to using the term **Flux** (e.g., "Flux Registry") instead of "Signal". 
- **Code Impact**: None. All `Signal` aliases still work perfectly.
- **Visual Impact**: You will see "Flux" in the inspector interface.

### 3. Context-Independent Inspector (Hotfix)
Previously, the `FluxyDevTools` required an `Overlay` and `MaterialLocalizations` existing in the widget tree above it.
- **Change**: The inspector is now fully self-contained. 
- **Benefit**: You can now safely use `Fluxy.debug` even in the most minimal `MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp` configurations without running into "No Overlay widget found" errors.

## Technical Improvements

### Package Size Optimization
The published package size has been reduced by approximately **40% (103 KB)**. This was achieved by stripping platform-specific boilerplate from the internal example directory and optimizing asset compression.

## Recommended Upgrade Path

1. Update your `pubspec.yaml` to `fluxy: ^0.2.1`.
2. Run `flutter pub get`.
3. If you were getting "No Overlay" or "No MaterialLocalizations" errors in v0.2.0, they will be resolved automatically after this update.
