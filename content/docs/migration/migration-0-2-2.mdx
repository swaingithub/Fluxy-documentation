# Migration to v0.2.2

Fluxy v0.2.2 is a minor maintenance release focusing on internal stabilization and finalizing the context-independent architecture of the DevTools.

## Summary of Changes

### Internal Stabilization
This version addresses edge cases in the Scoped Dependency Injection (`FxScope`) engine where certain `FxScope.route` objects might remain in memory under specific nested navigation scenarios.

### DevTools Context Refinements
Fine-tuned the internal `GlobalKey` management for the inspector shield to ensure consistent overlay behavior across all Flutter navigation stacks (Navigator 1.0 and 2.0).

## Recommended Upgrade Path
