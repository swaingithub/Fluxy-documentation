# Migration to v0.2.3

Fluxy v0.2.3 is a refinement release focused on the **Premium DevTools Overhaul** and preparing for the 1.0 stability milestone. This version includes significant improvements to the debugging experience and several internal bug fixes.

## Major New Features

### 1. Premium DevTools Overhaul
The Fluxy Inspector has been completely redesigned with a high-end Material 3 aesthetic and high-performance glassmorphism.
- **Glassmorphic HUD**: Redesigned FAB and inspector shield with smoother blur effects.
- **Real-time Update Flashing**: Flux/Signal items in the list now briefly flash blue when their value changes, making it easier to track state flow at a glance.
- **JSON Prettifier**: Direct inspection of network payloads is now much easier with automatic formatting and indentation.
- **Advanced Timeline Controls**: You can now search, pause, resume, and clear the state update timeline.
- **Persistent Search**: Search states in the Flux registry, DI container, and Network logs now persist across tab switches.
- **Clipboard API**: Integrated "Copy to Clipboard" buttons for signal values, network bodies, and log entries.

### 2. Context-Independent Inspector (v0.2.1+)
The DevTools are now fully self-contained. The framework no longer relies on the application's widget tree context for snackbars or overlays.
- Fixed the "No ScaffoldMessenger found" exception.
- Fixed "No Overlay widget found" and "No MaterialLocalizations found" errors.

## Technical Refinements

### Layout Safety
The DevTools Floating Action Button (FAB) has been moved up by **60dp** to prevent overlap with standard Flutter `BottomNavigationBar` items, ensuring it doesn't block your app's core navigation.

### Search & Live Editing (v0.2.1)
- **Flux Search**: Quickly filter through hundreds of signals by name or ID.
- **Live Value Editing**: You can now update `boolean`, `string`, and `numeric` values directly from the inspector, allowing for rapid state testing without hot-reloads.

### Performance & Size
- **Package Size**: Reduced the published package size by **~40%** by optimizing the example and internal assets.
- **Isolate Safety**: Improved crash-resistance in the DI and Network detail views for malformed or large data payloads.

## Recommended Upgrade Path

1. Update your `pubspec.yaml` to `fluxy: ^0.2.3`.
2. Run `flutter pub get`.
3. If using the CLI, run `dart pub global activate fluxy` to ensure your blueprints are up to date.
4. If you had previously hidden the DevTools due to context errors, you can now safely re-enable them using `Fluxy.debug`.

## Branding Update
The framework has transitioned to using **Flux** as the primary branding term for state units, replacing the generic 'Signal' terminology in the DevTools and documentation for better clarity and conflict avoidance.
