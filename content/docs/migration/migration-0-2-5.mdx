# Fluxy v0.2.5 - The Platform Era

Fluxy v0.2.5 represents a major shift from a "Framework" to a **"Managed Platform"**. This version consolidates fragmented plugins into a unified platform layer, introduces auto-registration, and strengthens production stability.

## Key Changes

### 1. Unified Platform API (`Fx.platform`)
Previously, plugins were accessed directly via the `Fx` namespace (e.g., `Fx.camera`, `Fx.notifications`). In v0.2.5, all native capabilities are consolidated under the `Fx.platform` namespace for better organization and long-term stability.

**Old Syntax:**
```dart
await Fx.camera.fullView(context);
Fx.notifications.show(title: "Hi");
```

**New Syntax (0.2.5+):**
```dart
await Fx.platform.camera.fullView(context);
Fx.platform.notifications.show(title: "Hi");
```

> **Note:** Direct access via `Fx.camera` or `Fx.storage` is still available as a getter alias for convenience, but we recommend using `Fx.platform` for clarity in large-scale projects.

### 2. Auto-Registration (`Fluxy.autoRegister`)
Manual plugin registration is now a thing of the past. The framework uses a generated registry to wire up your platform modules automatically.

**Old Syntax:**
```dart
void main() async {
  await Fluxy.init(
    plugins: [
      FluxyAuthPlugin(),
      FluxyCameraPlugin(),
    ],
  );
}
```

**New Syntax (0.2.5+):**
```dart
void main() async {
  await Fluxy.init();
  Fluxy.autoRegister(); // Automatically boots all installed modules
}
```

### 3. Hybrid Image Engine (`FxImage`)
The image engine has been completely re-engineered to support `file://` and `memory://` sources natively.

**New Primitives:**
- `Fx.img(src)`: Universal shorthand for network, asset, and local files.
- `Fx.memoryImage(bytes)`: Direct rendering from memory.

### 4. CLI Paradigm Shift
The CLI has pivoted from `fluxy plugin` to `fluxy module` to reflect the platform-first philosophy.

```bash
# Old
fluxy plugin add auth

# New
fluxy module add auth
```

## Breaking Changes & Deprecations

| Old | New | Type |
|-----|-----|------|
| `FluxyRoot` | `FluxyApp` or `Fx` | Recommended |
| `fluxy plugin` | `fluxy module` | CLI Deprecation |
| Manual Plugin List | `Fluxy.autoRegister()` | Architectural Shift |

## UI DSL Tweaks
The `.shadow.md` and similar style proxies have been slightly refined for better accumulation performance. Ensure you are using the method-call syntax `.shadow.md()` if you encounter lint warnings.

## Next Steps
After upgrading, run `fluxy doctor` to ensure your native Android/iOS dependencies are correctly synced with the new platform modules.
