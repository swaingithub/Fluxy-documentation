# Migrating to v0.2.6

Fluxy v0.2.6 introduces **Industrial Log Professionalization** and **Experimental Guardrails**. This guide will help you migrate from v0.2.5 to v0.2.6.

## Breaking Changes

### 1. Professional Logging System
The emoji-based logging system has been replaced with semantic bracketed tags for better readability and professional debugging.

### 2. Experimental Feature Guardrails
OTA, SDUI, and Cloud CLI features are now clearly marked as experimental with warnings.

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Update Core Package
Update your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fluxy: ^0.2.6
```

### Step 2: Update Log Monitoring
If you were monitoring specific emoji-based logs, update your log parsing:

```dart
// Before (v0.2.5)
// [KERNEL] Stability Kernel initialized
// [SYS] Package system ready
// [CAMERA] Camera module loaded

// After (v0.2.6)
// [KERNEL] [INIT] Stability Kernel initialized
// [SYS] [READY] Package system ready
// [CAMERA] [READY] Camera module loaded
```

### Step 3: Update Experimental Feature Usage
If you're using experimental features, be aware of new warnings:

```dart
// Experimental features now show warnings
// [EXPERIMENTAL] OTA updates are in beta - use with caution
// [EXPERIMENTAL] SDUI renderer is experimental - API may change
// [EXPERIMENTAL] Cloud CLI is experimental - not production ready
```

### Step 4: Run Flutter Pub Get
```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Log System Changes

### Before (v0.2.5)
```dart
// Emoji-based logs
// [KERNEL] Auto-repair applied to layout violation
// [SYS] Plugin registry initialized
// [CAMERA] Camera capture completed
// [AUTH] Authentication successful
// [NETWORK] HTTP request completed
```

### After (v0.2.6)
```dart
// Semantic bracketed tags
[KERNEL] [REPAIR] Auto-repair applied to layout violation
[SYS] [INIT] Plugin registry initialized
[CAMERA] [READY] Camera capture completed
[AUTH] [AUDIT] Authentication successful
[NETWORK] [DATA] HTTP request completed
```

## New Log Tag System

### System Components
- `[KERNEL]` - Core stability kernel operations
- `[SYS]` - System-level operations
- `[DATA]` - Data operations and persistence
- `[IO]` - Input/output operations

### Log Levels
- `[INIT]` - Initialization and startup
- `[READY]` - Component ready state
- `[AUDIT]` - Important operations and state changes
- `[REPAIR]` - Auto-repair operations
- `[FATAL]` - Critical errors
- `[PANIC]` - System-level emergencies

### Experimental Features
- `[EXPERIMENTAL]` - Experimental feature usage warnings

## Experimental Guardrails

### OTA (Over-the-Air) Updates
```dart
// New warning when using OTA
[EXPERIMENTAL] OTA updates are in beta - use with caution
[EXPERIMENTAL] FluxyRemote sync lifecycle may change
[EXPERIMENTAL] Remote manifest parsing is experimental
```

### SDUI (Server-Driven UI)
```dart
// New warning when using SDUI
[EXPERIMENTAL] SDUI renderer is experimental - API may change
[EXPERIMENTAL] JSON schema parsing is experimental
[EXPERIMENTAL] Dynamic styling is experimental
```

### Cloud CLI
```dart
// New warning when using Cloud CLI
[EXPERIMENTAL] Cloud CLI is experimental - not production ready
[EXPERIMENTAL] CI/CD scaffolding is experimental
[EXPERIMENTAL] GitHub Actions generation is experimental
```

## Testing Your Migration

### 1. Check Log Output
Run your app and verify logs appear with new format:

```dart
// Look for logs like this:
[KERNEL] [INIT] Fluxy initialized
[SYS] [READY] Plugin engine ready
[DATA] [AUDIT] State hydrated
```

### 2. Test Experimental Features
If using experimental features, verify warnings appear:

```dart
// Check for experimental warnings
[EXPERIMENTAL] Feature is experimental - use with caution
```

### 3. Verify Log Monitoring
Update any log monitoring systems to parse new format:

```dart
// Update regex patterns
// Old: /\[(KERNEL|SYS|CAMERA|AUTH|NETWORK)\]/
// New: /\[(KERNEL|SYS|DATA|IO)\]/
```

## 🆘 Common Issues

### Issue: Missing Emoji Logs
**Problem**: Logs don't show emojis anymore
**Solution**: This is intentional - update log monitoring to use semantic tags

### Issue: Experimental Warnings
**Problem**: Seeing new experimental warnings
**Solution**: These are intentional warnings - no action needed unless you want to avoid experimental features

### Issue: Log Parsing Failures
**Problem**: Log monitoring tools can't parse new format
**Solution**: Update parsing regex to match new bracketed tag format

## Benefits of Migration

### 1. Professional Logging
- **Better Readability**: Clear semantic tags instead of emojis
- **Standardized Levels**: Consistent severity indicators
- **ASCII Compatibility**: Works better with log analysis tools
- **Searchable**: Easier to filter and search logs

### 2. Experimental Guardrails
- **Clear Warnings**: Know when you're using experimental features
- **API Stability**: Understand which features may change
- **Production Safety**: Avoid experimental features in production
- **Better Documentation**: Clear experimental status

### 3. Improved Debugging
- **Categorization**: Clear component categorization
- **Severity Levels**: Standardized log levels
- **Diagnostic Clarity**: Better error tracking and debugging

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues during migration:

1. **Check the Changelog**: [Complete changelog](https://github.com/swaingithub/fluxy/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
2. **Review Examples**: Look at updated example projects
