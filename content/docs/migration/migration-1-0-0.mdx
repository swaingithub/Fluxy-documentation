# Migrating to v1.0.0

Fluxy v1.0.0 introduces a **modular architecture** that splits the monolithic package into focused modules. This guide will help you migrate from v0.2.6 to v1.0.0.

## 🚨 Breaking Changes

### 1. Modular Architecture
The single `fluxy` package has been split into:
- **Core Package** (172KB): Essential UI framework, DSL, and reactive system
- **12 Modular Packages**: Separate packages for specific features

### 2. Dependencies
Several features have moved to separate packages. You'll need to add explicit dependencies for features you use.

## 📋 Migration Steps

### Step 1: Update Core Package
Update your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fluxy: ^1.0.0  # Core package only
```

### Step 2: Add Modular Packages
Add the specific packages you need:

```yaml
dependencies:
  # Core Framework
  fluxy: ^1.0.0
  
  # Add modules based on your usage
  fluxy_forms: ^1.0.0        # If using forms/validation
  fluxy_camera: ^1.0.0       # If using camera functionality
  fluxy_auth: ^1.0.0         # If using authentication/biometrics
  fluxy_notifications: ^1.0.0 # If using push notifications
  fluxy_storage: ^1.0.0      # If using data persistence
  fluxy_test: ^1.0.0         # If using testing utilities
  fluxy_analytics: ^1.0.0    # If using analytics
  fluxy_biometric: ^1.0.0    # If using biometric authentication
  fluxy_connectivity: ^1.0.0 # If using network connectivity
  fluxy_permissions: ^1.0.0  # If using device permissions
  fluxy_platform: ^1.0.0     # If using platform integration
  fluxy_ota: ^1.0.0          # If using OTA updates
```

### Step 3: Update Import Statements
If you were importing from sub-packages, update your imports:

```dart
// Before (v0.2.6)
import 'package:fluxy/src/forms/fluxy_forms.dart';

// After (v1.0.0)
import 'package:fluxy_forms/fluxy_forms.dart';
```

### Step 4: Run Flutter Pub Get
```bash
flutter pub get
```

## 🔄 Feature Mapping

### Forms & Validation
```dart
// v0.2.6 (included in core)
import 'package:fluxy/fluxy.dart';

// v1.0.0 (separate package)
import 'package:fluxy_forms/fluxy_forms.dart';
```

### Camera Functionality
```dart
// v0.2.6 (included in core)
import 'package:fluxy/fluxy.dart';

// v1.0.0 (separate package)
import 'package:fluxy_camera/fluxy_camera.dart';
```

### Authentication & Biometrics
```dart
// v0.2.6 (included in core)
import 'package:fluxy/fluxy.dart';

// v1.0.0 (separate packages)
import 'package:fluxy_auth/fluxy_auth.dart';
import 'package:fluxy_biometric/fluxy_biometric.dart';
```

### Notifications
```dart
// v0.2.6 (included in core)
import 'package:fluxy/fluxy.dart';

// v1.0.0 (separate package)
import 'package:fluxy_notifications/fluxy_notifications.dart';
```

### Storage
```dart
// v0.2.6 (included in core)
import 'package:fluxy/fluxy.dart';

// v1.0.0 (separate package)
import 'package:fluxy_storage/fluxy_storage.dart';
```

## ✅ Compatibility Layer

Fluxy v1.0.0 includes a **compatibility layer** to make migration easier. Deprecated classes are still available but will show warnings:

```dart
// These still work but show deprecation warnings
@deprecated
class OldFluxyForms {
  // Implementation
}
```

## 🎯 Benefits of Migration

### 1. Smaller Core Package
- **Before**: 15MB+ monolithic package
- **After**: 172KB core + only modules you need

### 2. Faster Installation
- Only download features you actually use
- Independent versioning for each module

### 3. Better Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Focused development for each module

### 4. Flexible Dependencies
- Add/remove features without affecting core
- Choose specific versions for each module

## 🧪 Testing Your Migration

### 1. Check Dependencies
Run `flutter pub deps` to verify all dependencies are resolved correctly.

### 2. Test Core Functionality
Ensure basic Fluxy features still work:
```dart
import 'package:fluxy/fluxy.dart';

void main() async {
  await Fluxy.init();
  // Test basic functionality
}
```

### 3. Test Modular Features
Test each module you've added:
```dart
import 'package:fluxy_forms/fluxy_forms.dart';
import 'package:fluxy_camera/fluxy_camera.dart';

// Test forms, camera, etc.
```

## 🆘 Common Issues

### Issue: Import Errors
**Problem**: `Target of URI doesn't exist` errors
**Solution**: Add the missing modular package to `pubspec.yaml`

### Issue: Missing Features
**Problem**: Feature that worked in v0.2.6 doesn't work
**Solution**: Check if the feature moved to a separate package

### Issue: Version Conflicts
**Problem**: Dependency version conflicts
**Solution**: Use `flutter pub deps` to identify and resolve conflicts
