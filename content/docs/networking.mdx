# Networking

Fluxy v0.1.4 introduces a streamlined networking layer via `Fx.fetch<T>()`. This utility combines HTTP requests with Fluxy's reactivity, providing automatic state management (loading, data, error) for your endpoints.

## `Fx.fetch<T>()`

The `Fx.fetch` method returns an `AsyncSignal<T>`, which you can consume directly in your UI for a completely reactive experience.

### Basic Usage

```dart
final userPosts = Fx.fetch<List<Post>>(
  "https://api.example.com/posts",
  onSuccess: (data) => print("Fetched ${data.length} posts"),
);
```

### Advanced Configuration

`Fx.fetch` provides built-in support for common networking patterns like retries, debouncing, and timeouts.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `retries` | `int` | Number of times to retry the request on failure. |
| `retryDelay` | `Duration` | Wait time between retries. |
| `debounce` | `Duration` | Prevent rapid consecutive calls (useful for search). |
| `timeout` | `Duration` | Max time to wait for a response. |
| `headers` | `Map` | Custom HTTP headers. |

```dart
final searchResult = Fx.fetch<User>(
  "https://api.example.com/user/1",
  retries: 3,
  retryDelay: 2.seconds,
  debounce: 500.ms,
  timeout: 10.seconds,
);
```

## Consuming Data in the UI

Since `Fx.fetch` returns an `AsyncSignal`, you can use the `.on()` method to elegantly handle different loading states in your widgets.

```dart
Fx(() => userPosts.on(
  loading: () => Fx.loader().render(),
  error: (err) => Fx.text("Error: $err").color.red500.render(),
  data: (posts) => Fx.column()
    .children(
      posts.map((p) => Fx.text(p.title).p(8)).toList()
    )
    .render(),
))
```

## Managed State Pattern

Fluxy's networking follows the **Managed State** pattern. You don't need to manually create `isLoading` or `error` variables. The signal itself tracks these states, allowing you to focus on the UI and business logic while Fluxy handles the lifecycle of the request.
