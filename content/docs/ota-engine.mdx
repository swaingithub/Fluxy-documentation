# OTA Engine & Server-Driven UI

Fluxy includes a powerful engine for rendering UI dynamically from JSON and applying updates over-the-air.

## Server-Driven UI (SDUI)

The `FxRemoteView` and `FluxyRenderer` allow you to define full application screens or individual components in JSON and render them dynamically.

### Supported Widget Types
The renderer supports a wide range of atomic and layout widgets:
- **Layouts**: `row`, `column`, `box` (flexible container), `hero`.
- **Content**: `text`, `button`, `image`.

### Dynamic Data & Interpolation
Fluxy supports real-time data binding via interpolation. You can pass a `dataContext` to the renderer, and use the `{key}` syntax in your JSON.

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "data": "Hello, {user.name}!",
  "style": { "fontSize": 18 }
}
```

### Action Handlers
You can trigger local app events directly from your remote JSON using the `action` or `onTap` property:
- `navigate:/route`: Navigate to a specific path.
- `back`: Go back to the previous screen.
- `print:message`: Log a message to the console.

```json
{
  "type": "button",
  "label": "View Profile",
  "action": "navigate:/profile"
}
```

## CLI & Package Sync

In v0.1.4, the `fluxy` CLI and the `fluxy` Flutter package are synchronized. Ensure your CLI is up to date to support the latest OTA features.

```bash
dart pub global activate fluxy # Sync to v0.1.4
```

## Over-The-Air Updates

Fluxy enables Over-The-Air (OTA) updates for your application's UI and logic. This is achieved via `FluxyRemote` which can fetch and apply remote JSON manifests.

### FxRemoteView

Render dynamic UI segments from your backend.

```dart
FxRemoteView(
  url: "https://cdn.fluxy.dev/manifests/header_v2.json",
  loading: Fx.text("Syncing..."),
)
```

This allows you to update your app's layout, styles, and even basic logic without waiting for App Store or Google Play approval. It's the ultimate solution for A/B testing, emergency fixes, and seasonal UI changes.
