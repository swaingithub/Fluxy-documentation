# Performance Model

Fluxy is designed for maximum efficiency. Understanding its performance model helps you build smoother applications.

## Atomic Rebuilds

In standard Flutter, calling `setState` rebuilds the entire widget subtree. In Fluxy, only the specific value-listener is triggered.

### Comparison

| Operation | Flutter Standard | Fluxy |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| State Change | Full widget rebuild | Atomic element update |
| Tree Depth | Affects performance | Negligible impact |
| Layout Pass | Full subtree | Targeted |

## Render Optimization

Fluxy uses a custom `ReactiveElement` that intercepts changes and only marks the minimal necessary nodes for redrawing.

### Best Practices for Performance

1. **Keep Signals Granular**: Use multiple small signals instead of one large object signal.
2. **Use Computed**: Avoid doing heavy calculations inside the `build` method.
3. **Const Wrappers**: Use standard `const` constructors for static parts of your UI.
