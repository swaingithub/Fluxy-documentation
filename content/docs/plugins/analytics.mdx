# Analytics & Tracking

The `fluxy_analytics` module (accessible via the unified platform layer) provides a standardized event API for tracking user behavior, screen visits, and business conversions.

## Installation

Add the analytics module to your project:

```bash
fluxy module add analytics
```

## Basic Event Tracking

Log standard events via the unified platform API:

```dart
Fx.platform.analytics.logEvent('button_clicked', parameters: {
  'button_id': 'login_submit',
  'view': 'auth_screen',
});
```

## Screen Tracking

Fluxy can automatically or manually track screen transitions.

```dart
// In a Controller
@override
void onInit() {
  Fx.platform.analytics.logScreen('DashboardView');
}
```

## User Identification

Identify users to link their session data across multiple devices.

```dart
void onLoginSuccess(User user) {
  Fx.platform.analytics.identify(user.id, traits: {
    'email': user.email,
    'plan': 'premium',
  });
}

void onLogout() {
  Fx.platform.analytics.reset(); // Clears user traits
}
```

## Conversions & Business Goals

Track specific high-value activities using semantic conversion methods.

```dart
void onPurchaseComplete() {
  Fx.platform.analytics.logConversion('premium_upgrade', value: 29.99, currency: 'USD');
}
```

## Reactive Metrics

The module exposes reactive signals for analytics health and basic metrics, useful for technical dashboards.

```dart
Fx(() {
  final count = Fx.platform.analytics.eventCount.value;
  return Fx.text("Events Logged: $count");
});
```

## Best Practices
1. **Semantic Naming**: Use `snake_case` for all event names and parameters for consistency across different analytics backends.
2. **Identify Early**: Call `identify()` as soon as the user's ID is known (from `Fx.auth`) to tie anonymized sessions to a real user.
3. **GDPR Compliance**: Always check for user consent (using `Fx.storage` to save preferences) before initializing the analytics tracking on the first launch.
