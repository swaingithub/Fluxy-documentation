# Authentication

Fluxy's **Official Authentication Module** (`fluxy_auth`) provides a secure and reactive way to manage user identity, session tokens, and access control under the unified platform layer.

## Installation

Add the authentication module to your project:

```bash
fluxy module add auth
```

## Initialization

In the "Platform Era", use `Fluxy.autoRegister()` to initialize the authentication module along with other platform services.

```dart
void main() async {
  await Fluxy.init();
  Fluxy.autoRegister(); // Automatically boots auth and session tracking
  
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Core Functionality

### 1. User Login
The `login` method handles credential verification and automatically populates the reactive `user` signal via the unified platform API.

```dart
final success = await Fx.platform.auth.login("user@email.com", "password123");

if (success) {
  print("Welcome, ${Fx.platform.auth.user.value?['name']}");
}
```

### 2. Reactive Auth State (Session Tracking)
Everything in `fluxy_auth` is reactive. You can rebuild your UI automatically using the `isAuthenticated` signal.

```dart
Fx(() {
  if (Fx.platform.auth.isAuthenticated.value) {
    return DashboardView();
  }
  return LoginView();
});
```

## Security & Session Management

### Secure Persistence
By default, session tokens are securely encrypted and persisted using the standard Fluxy Platform Storage abstraction. You don't need to manually check for a "logged in" state in `onInit`.

### Session Termination
Terminate a session instantly across all framework layers:

```dart
void logout() {
  Fx.platform.auth.logout();
  Fluxy.offAll('/login');
}
```

## In-Depth: User Data
The `Fx.platform.auth.user` signal is a `Map<String, dynamic>?` that contains the identity payload returned by your backend. It remains synchronized across the entire application.

```dart
// Accessing profile data anywhere
final avatar = Fx.platform.auth.user.value?['avatar_url'];
final role = Fx.platform.auth.user.value?['role'];
```

## Best Practices
1. **Always use reactive builders**: Wrap your auth-dependent UI in `Fx()` to ensure instant updates.
2. **Combine with Biometrics**: For high-security apps, use `Fx.platform.auth` alongside `Fx.platform.biometric` to gate sensitive actions.
3. **Use Interceptors**: Fluxy's networking layer automatically picks up your `auth` token for authenticated requests.
