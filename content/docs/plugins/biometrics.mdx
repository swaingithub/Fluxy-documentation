# Biometric Authentication

Fluxy Biometrics (compatible with `fluxy_biometric v3.0+`) offers a high-level API to integrate secure authentication into your app. It handles different biometric types across iOS and Android with a unified interface and standardized platform prompts.

## Quick Start

Authenticate the user with a single line of code via the unified platform API:

```dart
bool authenticated = await Fx.platform.biometric.authenticate(
  reason: "Please authenticate to access your vault",
);

if (authenticated) {
  // Grant access
}
```

## Check Availability

Before requesting authentication, check if the device supports biometrics and has them enrolled.

```dart
if (await Fx.platform.biometric.isAvailable()) {
  final types = await Fx.platform.biometric.getAvailableTypes();
  // returns [BiometricType.face, BiometricType.fingerprint]
}
```

## Reactive State Monitoring

The Biometric module exposes reactive signals for hardware availability and authentication status, allowing your UI to update instantly.

```dart
Fx(() {
  final isAvailable = Fx.platform.biometric.isAvailable.value;
  final isAuth = Fx.platform.biometric.isAuthenticated.value;

  return _statusChip(
    label: isAuth ? "Verified" : "Hardware: $isAvailable",
    color: isAuth ? Colors.green : Colors.grey,
  );
});
```

## Security Options

### Strong vs. Weak
Enforce strong biometrics (Face ID/Fingerprint) for sensitive actions or allow weak ones (Passcode fallback) for convenience.

```dart
await Fx.platform.biometric.challenge(
  reason: "Access Secure Vault",
  strongAuthOnly: true, // Requires hardware biometrics
);
```

### Standardized Prompts
In v3.0+, Fluxy standardizes the authentication dialogs across both platforms, ensuring a consistent and premium user experience regardless of the device.

### Error Pipeline Integration
Biometric failures (like cancellations or hardware errors) are now integrated into the **Fluxy Error Pipeline**. You can handle them globally:

```dart
Fluxy.onError((error, stack) {
  if (error is BiometricException) {
    Fx.toast.error("Security alert: ${error.message}");
  }
});
```

## Best Practices
1. **Fallback Logic**: Always have a password-based fallback if biometrics fail or are not available.
2. **Contextual Challenges**: Don't authenticate on every app launch unless strictly necessary (e.g., banking apps). Use it to gate specific high-value actions.
3. **Hardware Readiness**: Use the `Fx.platform.biometric.isAvailable` signal to hide or show biometric settings in your profile view.
