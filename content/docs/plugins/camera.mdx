# Camera

The Fluxy Camera plugin simplifies camera integration by providing pre-built modals and streamlined controller management. It is optimized for real-time preview and fully integrated with the `FxImage` engine.

## Full View Modal

The most common use case is opening a full-screen camera view to capture photos or scan codes.

```dart
final XFile? photo = await Fx.platform.camera.fullView(
  context: context,
  enableAutoCapture: false,
);
```

## Inline Camera

For custom layouts, use the `FxCamera` widget:

```dart
Fx.col().children([
  FxCamera(
    onCapture: (file) => print("Saved to ${file.path}"),
    controller: myController,
  ).h(300).rounded(20),
  
  Fx.button("Switch Camera").onTap(() => myController.toggleLens()),
]);
```

## Features

- **Quick UI**: Open a professional camera interface with one call.
- **Smart Constraints**: Automatically handles aspect ratios and orientations.
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for real-time scanning and preview.

## Permissions

Fluxy Camera manages permissions gracefully. It will request camera and gallery access on the first call if not already granted.

```dart
if (await Fx.platform.camera.hasPermission()) {
  // ready to go
}
```

## Advanced Configuration

You can customize the camera behavior during initialization:

```dart
Fluxy.init(
  plugins: [
    FluxyCameraPlugin(
      resolution: ResolutionPreset.ultraHigh, // 4K support
      enableAudio: true,
    ),
  ],
);
```

## Best Practices
1. **Contextual Permissions**: Only trigger `fullView()` or check permissions when the user explicitly clicks a "Scan" or "Capture" button.
2. **Dispose Assets**: If you captured local files to temporary storage, use `Fx.storage` to track them and clean up old photos periodically.
3. **Handle No-Hardware**: Always check `Fx.platform.camera.cameras.isEmpty` to show a fallback message for devices without working lenses (like older emulators).
