# Haptic Feedback

Fluxy's Haptic Engine provides a high-level, semantic API for digital touch confirmation. It abstracts away raw platform vibration calls into professional-grade sensory signals.

## Usage

The haptic engine is available via the static `Fx.haptic` helper (or `FxHaptic` directly). 

```dart
void onButtonTap() {
  Fx.haptic.light(); // Light confirmation tap
}
```

## Semantic Levels

### 1. Selection & Light Interactions
Use for standard button clicks, toggle changes, or scroll ticks.
```dart
Fx.haptic.light();
```

### 2. Physical Impact
Use for drag-and-drop actions, component snaps, or satisfying UI physics.
```dart
Fx.haptic.medium();
Fx.haptic.heavy();
```

### 3. State Notifications
Use to provide physical weight to successful operations or critical errors.
```dart
Fx.haptic.success(); // A satisfying "double pulse"
Fx.haptic.error();   // A recognizable "alarm" vibration
```

## Global Control

You can disable haptics globally (e.g., when the device is in low-power mode or based on user settings).

```dart
Fx.haptic.enabled = false; // Silences all haptic calls instantly
```

## Best Practices
1. **Never Overuse**: Haptics should be subtle. Only trigger them on explicit user actions, not on every background data change.
2. **Success/Error Pairing**: Always use `Fx.haptic.success()` alongside success toasts and `Fx.haptic.error()` alongside error alerts for a truly premium, accessible experience.
3. **Accessibility**: Haptics are a vital part of accessibility for users with visual impairments—use them to reinforce critical UI state changes.
