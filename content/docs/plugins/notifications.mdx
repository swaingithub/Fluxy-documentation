# Notifications

Fluxy provides an industrial-grade notification system that handles channels, permissions, and scheduling with zero-config.

## [GUIDE] Industrial Step-by-Step

### 1. Installation (via CLI)
Add the notifications module using the Fluxy CLI to maintain architectural integrity.
```bash
fluxy module add notifications
```

### 2. Managed Boot Sequence
Ensure your `main.dart` is configured with the mandatory three-step boot sequence.
```dart
import 'package:fluxy/fluxy.dart';
import 'core/registry/fluxy_registry.dart'; 

void main() async {
  await Fluxy.init();
  Fluxy.registerRegistry(() => registerFluxyPlugins()); 
  Fluxy.autoRegister(); // Boots notification listeners and channels
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### 3. Usage (Unified API)
Access the module through the stable `Fx.platform` gateway.

```dart
// Show immediate notification
Fx.platform.notifications.show(
  title: "New Message",
  body: "You have received a new update.",
);

// Schedule for later
Fx.platform.notifications.schedule(
  id: 1,
  title: "Reminder",
  body: "Time for your standup!",
  scheduledDate: DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1)),
);
```

## Core Functionality

### 1. Groups & Channels
Organize notifications into categories for better user control (Android).

```dart
Fx.platform.notifications.createChannel(
  id: "marketing",
  name: "Marketing Updates",
  importance: Importance.max,
);
```

### 2. Timezone Awareness
Notifications are timezone-aware by default, triggering at the correct local time even if the user travels.

## The Wrong Way vs. The Right Way

| Feature | [WRONG] The Outdated Way | [RIGHT] The Fluxy Standard |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Plugin Access** | `FluxyPluginEngine.find<FluxyNotificationsPlugin>()` | `Fx.platform.notifications` |
| **Logic** | Manual boilerplate for channels | Auto-channeling via the platform API |
| **Scheduling** | Guessing timezones for alerts | Native timezone-aware scheduling |
| **Permissions** | Calling `permission_handler` directly | `await Fx.platform.notifications.requestPermission()` |

---

## Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

### 1. "Scheduled notifications don't fire after reboot"
*   **The Cause**: Missing `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` permission.
*   **The Fix**: Ensure your manifest includes the tags or let Fluxy CLI inject them.

### 2. "Notifications don't show on Android 13+"
*   **The Cause**: Not requesting `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission explicitly.
*   **The Fix**: Use `requestPermission()` before attempting to show any alerts.

### 3. "The app crashes when creating a channel"
*   **The Cause**: Duplicate channel IDs or invalid importance levels.
*   **The Fix**: Verify channel IDs are unique and use the `Importance` enum.

## Best Practices
1. **Contextual Requests**: Only ask for notification permissions when it makes sense (e.g., after an order).
2. **Clear Channels**: Use descriptive names so users can choose what to disable.
3. **Payload Management**: Use JSON payloads to route users to deep-linked screens on tap.
