# Cloud & CI/CD

Fluxy helps you move from "Local Development" to "Global Production" with one command. The CLI includes automated scaffolding for continuous integration and delivery pipelines.

---

## Setting up GitHub Actions

You can project-configure your GitHub workflows for Android and iOS builds in seconds.

### Android Build Setup
```bash
fluxy cloud build android
```
**What this does:**
- Creates `.github/workflows/fluxy_android_build.yml`.
- Configures JDK 17 and Flutter stable.
- Sets up an automatic release APK build on every push to `main`.
- Uploads the resulting APK as a GitHub artifact.

### iOS Build Setup
```bash
fluxy cloud build ios
```
**What this does:**
- Creates `.github/workflows/fluxy_ios_build.yml`.
- Configures the macOS runner for iOS compilation.
- Prepares a release IPA (non-codesigned by default for internal testing).

---

## Deployment Scaffolding

Generate a deployment pipeline that can be triggered manually via a "Workflow Dispatch" on GitHub.

```bash
fluxy cloud deploy
```

**Key Features:**
- **Track Selection**: Choose between Alpha, Beta, or Production tracks during manual trigger.
- **Fastlane Ready**: Scaffolds the logic required to connect to Play Store or App Store Connect.

## Why use Fluxy Cloud CLI?

1.  **Industrial Standards**: We use the exact environment versions (Java, Ruby, Flutter) tested for Fluxy compatibility.
2.  **Infrastructure as Code**: Your build process lives in your repository, making it reproducible for the whole team.
3.  **Audit Logs**: Failed builds are logged according to Fluxy's semantic logging standards for easier debugging.

## Best Practices

- **Secrets Management**: Never commit your `.jks` keys or `.p12` certificates. Store them in GitHub Repository Secrets.
- **Artifact Expiry**: By default, GitHub keeps build artifacts for 90 days. We recommend downloading and testing your releases immediately.

**Workflow Integration:** After running the cloud commands, simply `git push` to your repository, and head to the **Actions** tab on GitHub to see your industrial pipeline in motion.
