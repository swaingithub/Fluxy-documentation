# Quick Start

Get started with Fluxy in just a few commands.

## Installation

Install the Fluxy CLI globally using Dart. This tool will manage your projects and generate code for you.

```bash
dart pub global activate fluxy
```

## Creating a Project

Initialize a new Fluxy project structure. This command sets up the necessary folders for modules, routes, and themes.

```bash
fluxy init my_awesome_app
```

## Running Your App

Run your application using the optimized Fluxy dev runner for a better developer experience.

```bash
fluxy run
```

## Your First Widget

Replace your `main.dart` with this minimal Fluxy application. `FluxyApp` handles your routing and theme engine automatically.

```dart
import 'package:fluxy/fluxy.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    FluxyApp(
      title: "Hello Fluxy",
      initialRoute: FxRoute(
        path: "/",
        builder: (context, args) => Fx.center(
          child: Fx.text("Hello World").font.xxl.bold,
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```
