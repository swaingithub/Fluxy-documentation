# Quick Start

Get started with Fluxy in just a few commands.

## Installation

Install the Fluxy CLI globally using Dart. This tool will manage your projects and generate code for you.

```bash
dart pub global activate fluxy
```

## Creating a Project

Initialize a new Fluxy project structure. This command sets up the necessary folders for modules, routes, and themes.

```bash
fluxy init my_awesome_app
```

## Running Your App

Run your application using the optimized Fluxy dev runner for a better developer experience.

```bash
fluxy run
```

## Quick Feature Generation

Instead of writing everything from scratch, use **Fluxy Blueprints** to generate complete, working features:

```bash
# Generate a complete login feature
fluxy g auth login
```

## Your First App

A professional Fluxy application requires initialization. Here is a minimal `main.dart` setup:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fluxy/fluxy.dart';

void main() async {
  // 1. Setup core engine
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Fluxy.init();
  
  runApp(
    FluxyApp(
      title: "Hello Fluxy",
      initialRoute: FxRoute(
        path: "/",
        builder: (context, args) => Fx.center(
          child: Fx.text("Hello World").font.xxl.bold.blue600,
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```



## Next Steps

Once your project is set up, explore the core concepts:

- [Reactivity](/docs/reactivity): Learn about Signals and computed values.
- [Atomic Styling DSL](/docs/ui-dsl): Use the `Fx` namespace to build UI.
- [Premium Widgets](/docs/widgets): Explore pre-styled components.
- [Routing](/docs/routing): Set up type-safe navigation.
