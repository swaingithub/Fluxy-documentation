# Quick Start

Get started with Fluxy in the **Platform Era** in just a few commands.

## Installation

Install the Fluxy CLI globally using Dart. This tool will manage your projects, modules, and generate code for you.

```bash
dart pub global activate fluxy
```

## Creating a Project

Initialize a new Fluxy project structure. This command sets up the official `core/features` architecture.

```bash
fluxy init my_awesome_app
```

## Adding Modules

Fluxy is now modular. Add the features you need using the `module` command:

```bash
# Add storage and authentication
fluxy module add storage
fluxy module add auth
```

## Your First App

A professional Fluxy application requires initialization and module registration. Here is a minimal `main.dart` setup:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fluxy/fluxy.dart';

void main() async {
  // 1. Setup core engine
  await Fluxy.init();
  
  // 2. Auto-register all installed modules
  Fluxy.autoRegister();
  
  runApp(
    FluxyApp(
      title: "Hello Fluxy",
      initialRoute: FxRoute(
        path: "/",
        builder: (context, args) => Fx.center(
          child: Fx.text("Hello World").font.xxl().font.bold().color(Fx.primary),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Next Steps

Once your project is set up, explore the core concepts:

- [Reactivity](/docs/fundamentals/signals): Learn about Flux signals and automatic updates.
- [Atomic Styling DSL](/docs/style/atomic-dsl): Use the `Fx` namespace to build flat UI trees.
- [Ecosystem](/docs/plugins/notifications): Explore the power of Platform Modules.
- [Routing](/docs/ecosystem/routing): Set up type-safe navigation with automated controller registration.
