# Quick Start

Get started with Fluxy in just a few commands.

## Installation

Install the Fluxy CLI globally using Dart. This tool will manage your projects and generate code for you.

```bash
dart pub global activate fluxy
```

## Creating a Project

Initialize a new Fluxy project structure. This command sets up the necessary folders for modules, routes, and themes.

```bash
fluxy init
```

## Running Your App

Run your application using the standard Flutter command or the Fluxy CLI helper if available.

```bash
flutter run
```

## Next Steps

Once your project is set up, explore the core concepts:

- [Reactivity](/docs/reactivity): Learn about Signals and computed values.
- [Fluent UI](/docs/fluent-ui): Use the `Fx` namespace to build UI.
- [Routing](/docs/routing): Set up type-safe navigation.
