# Routing with Fluxy

Fluxy includes a type-safe routing system that supports deep links and navigation.

## Defining Routes

Routes are defined declaratively in your main module.

```dart
// main.dart
final routes = [
  FxRoute("/", () => HomePage()),
  FxRoute("/profile", () => ProfilePage()),
  FxRoute("/settings", () => SettingsPage()),
];
```

## Navigation

To navigate, use the `FxRouter` or helper function.

```dart
FxRouter.to("/profile");
FxRouter.back();
```

## Passing Arguments

You can pass arguments directly into route functions in a strictly typed manner.

```dart
FxRoute("/user/:id", (context, args) => UserPage(id: args["id"])),
```

When navigating:

```dart
FxRouter.to("/user/123");
```

## Middleware

Add authentication guards or logging with **Middleware**.

```dart
FxRoute(
  "/admin", 
  () => AdminPage(), 
  middleware: [AuthGuard()],
);
```

If the middleware fails (e.g. user not logged in), navigation is blocked or redirected.
