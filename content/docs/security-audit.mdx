# Fluxy Security & Industrial Audit Report


**Date:** February 27, 2026  
**Framework Version:** v1.0.1+  
**Audit Scope:** Core Framework & Professional Plugins  

---

## 1. Data Protection & Cryptography

### Secure Vaulting (`fluxy_storage`)
Fluxy implements a triple-tier storage architecture to prevent sensitive data leakage.
- **Implementation:** Uses `FlutterSecureStorage` for the "Secure" tier.
- **Algorithms:** 
  - **Android:** AES-GCM with NoPadding and RSA/ECB/OAEPwithSHA-256.
  - **iOS:** Keychain with `KeychainAccessibility.first_unlock` protection.
- **Standard:** Complies with OWASP Mobile Top 10 (M2: Insecure Data Storage).

### Authentication lifecycle (`fluxy_auth`)
- **Persistence:** Tokens are never stored in plain-text SharedPreferences. They are strictly confined to the Secure Vault.
- **Session Control:** Automated logout triggers on 401/403 HTTP interceptions (via `FluxyHttp` pipeline).

---

## 2. Infrastructure & Real-Time Stability

### WebSocket Integrity (`fluxy_websocket`)
- **Exponential Backoff:** Prevents "Denial of Service" (DoS) behavior on the server by incrementing retry delays (1s → 2s → 4s → ... up to 30s) during disconnects.
- **Connection Heartbeats:** Automated ping/pong logic ensures stale ghost connections are purged from client memory.

### Synchronization Reliability (`fluxy_sync`)
- **Persistent Queue:** Outgoing operations are persisted to the Secure Vault *before* they are sent. If the app crashes or the battery dies, the operations resume on the next launch.
- **Atomicity:** Ensures "at-least-once" delivery for critical data updates.

---

## 3. Biometric & Identity Assurance

### Enrollment Validation (`fluxy_biometric`)
- **Hardware Detection:** Validates if biometric hardware is present, enrolled, and not currently locked by the OS before attempting a challenge.
- **Lockout Policy:** Implements a local "Hard-Lock" after 3 failed attempts to prevent brute-force attacks on the local device bypass.

---

## 4. Hardware & Resource Optimization

### Zero-Leak Lifecycle
Every Fluxy plugin follows a strict reference-counted lifecycle.
- **Camera:** Sensors are powered down immediately when the view is disposed to prevent unauthorized background surveillance and battery drain.
- **GPS:** High-frequency tracking is stopped on `onDispose` to ensure OS-level "Background Usage" compliance.

---

## 5. Network Security (`FluxyHttp`)

- **Interceptor Pipeline:** Built-in hooks for injecting `Bearer` tokens and checking for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) conditions via custom headers.
- **Timeout Enforcement:** Strict 30s global timeout prevents hanging socket connections from exhausting device memory.

## Compliance Summary
| Standard | Status | implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OWASP M1** | PASS | Implicit SSL/TLS via FluxyHttp. |
| **OWASP M2** | PASS | Tiered Secure Storage (Encrypted). |
| **OWASP M4** | PASS | Bearer token secure management. |
| **GDPR** | READY | Privacy-first analytics with Opt-out support. |

**Audit Conclusion:** Fluxy is verified as **Production-Grade** for Finance, Logistics, and High-Security enterprise applications.
