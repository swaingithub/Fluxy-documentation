# Styling with FxStyle

Fluxy provides a powerful styling system that allows you to manage themes, colors, and responsive breakpoints effortlessly.

## The `FxStyle` Class

`FxStyle` is the entry point for all styling-related properties.

```dart
FxStyle.colors.primary;
FxStyle.text.header1;
```

This namespace provides quick access to your global design token. You can configure your theme here and use it throughout your app.

## Responsive Breakpoints

Fluxy includes built-in breakpoint support.

```dart
FxStyle.media(context).isMobile;
FxStyle.media(context).isTablet;
FxStyle.media(context).isDesktop;
```

This makes it easy to conditionally render UI or apply styles based on screen size.

## Dark Mode Support

Switching themes is handled automatically by the Engine if configured, or manually via `FxStyle`.

```dart
FxStyle.toggleTheme();
```
