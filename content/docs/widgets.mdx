# Premium Widget Suite

Fluxy v0.1.1 introduces a suite of "Premium" widgets designed to handle common UI patterns with minimal configuration and built-in reactivity.

## FxAvatar

A versatile avatar widget with support for images, fallbacks, and multiple sizes.

```dart
FxAvatar(
  image: "https://example.com/user.jpg",
  fallback: Fx.text("JD").render(),
  size: FxAvatarSize.lg,
  shape: FxAvatarShape.circle,
)
```

- **Sizes**: `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`.
- **Shapes**: `circle`, `rounded`.

## FxBadge

Wraps any widget with a notification dot or a label.

```dart
FxBadge(
  label: "5",
  child: Icon(Icons.notifications),
)
```

## FxDropdown

An Overlay-based selective UI that feels more like a modern web select than a native mobile dropdown. It binds directly to a Signal.

```dart
final selectedValue = flux("Option 1");

FxDropdown<String>(
  value: selectedValue,
  options: ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"],
  onChanged: (val) => selectedValue.value = val,
)
```

## FxBottomBar

A pill-style, animated navigation bar with physics-based selection tracking. It provides a premium, "springy" feel out of the box.

```dart
FxBottomBar(
  selectedIndex: currentTab,
  items: [
    FxBottomBarItem(icon: Icons.home, label: "Home"),
    FxBottomBarItem(icon: Icons.search, label: "Search"),
    FxBottomBarItem(icon: Icons.person, label: "Profile"),
  ],
  onTap: (index) => currentTab.value = index,
)
```

## FxTabScaffold (Parallel Navigation)

The `FxTabScaffold` is a high-level widget for building complex tab-based apps with **parallel navigation stacks**. This means each tab maintains its own navigation history.

```dart
final currentTab = flux(0);

FxTabScaffold(
  currentIndex: currentTab,
  tabs: [
    FxTabItem(
      label: "Home",
      icon: Icons.home,
      initialRoute: "/",
      routes: homeRoutes,
    ),
    FxTabItem(
      label: "Search",
      icon: Icons.search,
      initialRoute: "/discover",
      routes: searchRoutes,
    ),
  ],
)
```

- When you navigate within the "Home" tab, the "Search" tab's state is preserved.
- Use `Fluxy.to("/some-path", scope: "Home")` to navigate within a specific tab's stack.

## Usage in DSL

All premium widgets are also available via the `Fx` namespace for a consistent development experience:

```dart
Fx.avatar(image: "...")
  .shadowMD()
  .render();
```
